# MapGenerator Software Architecture

## Domain layer:

![Application architecture](https://github.com/otsohelos/ot_harjoitustyo/blob/master/MapGenerator/documentation/architecture.jpg)


## Sequence diagram
Example case of MapUI calling the creation of a new map, with user-chosen variables:
height 120
width 150
highVariability false
coastal true

Randomized integer variables are represented as (int)
Case-dependent variables are represented as their names (i, j, stopWhen, elevation etc.)

Slightly simplified sequence diagram:
