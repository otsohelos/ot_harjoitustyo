# Instructions

Download [MapGenerator](https://github.com/otsohelos/ot_harjoitustyo/releases/tag/v1.1).

## Startup

MapGenerator requires Java 1.8.

The downloaded MapGenerator package can be started by navigating to the relevant folder and entering the command 

```
java -jar MapGenerator-1.1.jar
```

## Settings

First you will be taken to a Settings view.

### Dimensions

Height and Width are the dimensions of your map. These should be between 40 and 260. On most screens, a height of less than 150 is recommended.

### Variability of elevation

High variability means the elevation is likely to change more from square to square.

### Land type

The Coastal setting gives you an archipelago region, with large amounts of water. A Coastal map is likely to be surrounded by water on all edges. The Inland setting gives you more land and less water.

When you've chosen your settings, press Generate.
